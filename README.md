# 🌾 OneAgroBharat – Crop Yield Prediction using ML & Cloud Deployment
A machine learning-powered solution designed to forecast crop yields based on agricultural factors including soil composition (Area), weather patterns (Rainfall & Temperature), pesticide usage, and crop cultivation history. This project empowers data-driven decision-making in agriculture by predicting yield outcomes with precision.

🚀 Features
- ML Modeling: Implemented and compared multiple regression algorithms—Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, Linear, Lasso, and Ridge Regression—to optimize prediction accuracy
- Parameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization; model performance evaluated using RMSE and R² metrics
- API Integration: Developed a lightweight Flask API to deliver real-time yield predictions via accessible endpoints
- Containerization: Dockerized the entire app for portability and seamless deployment across diverse environments
- Cloud Infrastructure: Utilized AWS EC2 for scalable model training and hosting of prediction services
- Version Control: Followed Git-based workflows to enable collaborative development and reproducible results
